<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I’m Venu Gopal Reddy, a Mechanical Engineering student at UVCE (Bangalore) with a passion for product development, web technologies, and digital marketing. Alongside my engineering foundation in tools like CATIA, FluidSIM, MATLAB, and CNC programming, I’ve been building hands-on skills in web development with HTML, CSS, and responsive design frameworks such as Bootstrap. My journey also extends to the digital space, where I successfully grew a YouTube channel to over 3,000 subscribers and 800,000+ views through SEO, content strategy, and branding. I enjoy combining creativity with problem-solving—whether it’s designing user-friendly websites, developing technical projects, or crafting digital content—and I’m eager to bring this multidisciplinary approach to real-world challenges in product development and marketing.</p>
